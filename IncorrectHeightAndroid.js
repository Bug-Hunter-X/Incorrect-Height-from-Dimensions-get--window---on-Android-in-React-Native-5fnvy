This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially on Android.  The issue is that `Dimensions.get('window')` might return incorrect values, particularly the height, if called before the layout has been completely determined. This frequently happens during component mounting or early in the lifecycle.  The height might be zero, or a significantly smaller value than expected.
